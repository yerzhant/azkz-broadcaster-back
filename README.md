## GraphQL code generation with DGS

This project has been configured to use the Netflix DGS Codegen plugin.
This plugin can be used to generate client files for accessing remote GraphQL services.
The default setup assumes that the GraphQL schema file for the remote service is added to the `src/main/resources/graphql-client/` location.

You can learn more about the [plugin configuration options](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/generating-code-from-schema/#configuring-code-generation) and
[how to use the generated types](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/generating-code-from-schema/) to adapt the default setup.


### Docker Compose support
This project contains a Docker Compose file named `compose.yaml`.
In this file, the following services have been defined:

* postgres: [`postgres:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Please review the tags of the used images and set them to the same as you're running in production.

## GraalVM Native Support

This project has been configured to let you generate either a lightweight container or a native executable.
It is also possible to run your tests in a native image.

### Lightweight Container with Cloud Native Buildpacks
If you're already familiar with Spring Boot container images support, this is the easiest way to get started.
Docker should be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image.

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm radio:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

### Executable with Native Build Tools
Use this option if you want to explore more options such as running your tests in a native image.
The GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed and configured on your machine.

NOTE: GraalVM 22.3+ is required.

To create the executable, run the following goal:

```
$ ./gradlew nativeCompile
```

Then, you can run the app as follows:
```
$ build/native/nativeCompile/radio
```

You can also run your existing tests suite in a native image.
This is an efficient way to validate the compatibility of your application.

To run your existing tests in a native image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./gradlew nativeTest
```

### Gradle Toolchain support

There are some limitations regarding Native Build Tools and Gradle toolchains.
Native Build Tools disable toolchain support by default.
Effectively, native image compilation is done with the JDK used to execute Gradle.
You can read more about [toolchain support in the Native Build Tools here](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/gradle-plugin.html#configuration-toolchains).

### Testcontainers support

This project uses [Testcontainers at development time](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/3.4.2/reference/features/dev-services.html#features.dev-services.testcontainers).

Testcontainers has been configured to use the following Docker images:

* [`postgres:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Please review the tags of the used images and set them to the same as you're running in production.
